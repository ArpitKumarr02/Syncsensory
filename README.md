# SyncSensory

## About the Project
SyncSensory is a project started in August 2023 to revolutionize how we experience media. By November 2023, we began working on gloves that allow users to feel what they see on their screens, like the warmth of a campfire or the chill of snow.

## Our Team
Currently, our team consists of four passionate members, but we need more help to bring SyncSensory to life.

## How You Can Help
We're looking for developers, designers, and anyone with unique skills that can contribute to the project. If you're interested, please contact us through Instagram, leave a comment here, or reach out on Discord.
