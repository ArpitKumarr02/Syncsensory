Help us make watching TV or using phones more immersive! You can contribute by donating old tools or financial support. As many of our team members are teenagers who cannot earn their own money, your support is crucial. For privacy and safety reasons, we haven't provided a number or address here. If you'd like to donate or get in touch, please contact the SyncSensory founder through the following:

Your support will make a significant difference in bringing our innovative project to life!
